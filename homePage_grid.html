        <div class="body-text1-section">I am 21 years and I live in Memphis, Tennessee where I am currently attending
            CodeCrew Code School. Since the start of my program I have
            been participating in various code events such as Game Jams, family code days, and Code-Op networking events
            giving me opportunities to build
            my experience. It is such a joy for me to work with all of these awesome teams of incredible people, and a
            true honor to be able
            to learn so much from them. I got the chance to create apps, video games, even teach code, and my love for
            development is only growing more
            everyday. The closer I get to my graduation in June, the more hungry I am for opportunity to contribute to
            this ever growing tech field.
            I am looking for an entry-level position at a company that will value my love for teamwork and attention to
            detail along with my fresh knowledge
            of coding. If you also happen to be looking for a new developer eager to contribute please feel free to
            explore this site further for more details
            and contact information.
