        <td colspan="3"><h1>About Me</h1>I am 21 years and I live in Memphis, Tennessee where I am currently attending CodeCrew Code School. Since the start of my program I have
            been participating in various code events such as Game Jams, family code days, and Code-Op networking events giving me opportunities to build
            my experience. It is such a joy for me to work with all of these awesome teams of incredible people, and a true honor to be able
            to learn so much from them. I got the chance to create apps, video games, even teach code, and my love for development is only growing more
            everyday. The closer I get to my graduation in June, the more hungry I am for opportunity to contribute to this ever growing tech field.
            I am looking for an entry-level position at a company that will value my love for teamwork and attention to detail along with my fresh knowledge
            of coding. If you also happen to be looking for a new developer eager to contribute please feel free to explore this site further for more details
            and contact information.
