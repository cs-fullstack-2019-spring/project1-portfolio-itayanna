<div class="clickerText">
    This is a simple 2 player click game. The player to reach a certain amount first wins. I programed this in JavaScript in an HTML file with simple CSS styling.
    this what a really fun project for me to do because it was a game that I could play with my little siblings and cousins. It meant a lot to me to see something i made
    being played by the kids in my life and seeing them have so much fun.

<div class="showHideText">
    This show hide game was also really fun. I was able to customize it to incorporate my favorite anime show. I actually used mostly JQuery for all the logic., but
    like the click game it is just in a simple HTML file.

<div class="ticTactoeText">
    This was the first game we got to do in class. Tic Tac Toe! Most of the other programs before these were in the terminal and didn't have a frontend to show.
    Ita was also another fun thing to enjouy with friends and family. I used Javascript for this one as well.
